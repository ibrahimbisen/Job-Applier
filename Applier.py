cover_letter = "Dear Hiring Manager, I am writing to express my interest in the aerospace and \
	robotics engineering internship at your esteemed company. I am currently a junior pursuing a \
	Bachelor of Science in Aerospace Engineering with a minor in Computer Science at the University \
	of Texas at Austin, set to graduate in Fall 2025. My hands-on experience with relevant projects \
	and internships has equipped me with a solid foundation in both fields. I am eager to leverage my\
	  skills to contribute to your team and further enhance my expertise in engineering and software \
	development. Since high school, I have been passionate about model rocketry and have diligently\
	  worked towards obtaining my Level 2 certification in high-power rocketry. My academic coursework, \
	coupled with practical experience, has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of this field. \
	I have successfully completed projects such as creating a 5-foot-long, 4-inch diameter fiberglass and \
	carbon fiber composite body tube and designing a reaction wheel using a BLDC motor. I developed the reaction \
	wheel using 3D printing, CNC machining, and C++ programming, which takes real-time input from a 9-DOF IMU to \
	stabilize the rocket for video recording. In the past year, I have dedicated myself to developing a humanoid \
	quadruped robot named Gray. This project has allowed me to hone my skills in designing lightweight and efficient\
	  SolidWorks and CAD models while mastering the manufacturing process with 3D FDM and SLA printers to achieve \
	maximum durability and strength. My ultimate goal is to enable Gray to walk autonomously using a machine \
	learning algorithm, which I am currently integrating into the robot. My commitment to learning\
	  CAD design and software engineering with Python, MATLAB, C++, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript has\
	  been both challenging and rewarding. Thank you for taking the time to consider my application. \
	I am grateful for the opportunity to potentially join your team and contribute to the exciting \
	projects at your company. I am confident that my background and passion for aerospace and \
	robotics engineering make me a strong candidate for this internship. Sincerely, \
	Ibrahim Bisen"
